# NiftyGreekHandouts
Classical Greek Morphology overviews (mostly). No explanations, just the forms.

These handouts originate from my bereft feeling when I started teaching in the US and could no longer refer my students to the _Kleine Griekse Grammatica_ by Nuchelmans, whose §36 (λύω) had all but fallen out of my copy by the time I graduated high school. My searches failed to turn up an English-language equivalent for these go-to paradigms. 

*Almostallhandouts.pdf* contains: 

-a and o declension plus definite article

-def. art., relative, indef., interrog., demonstratives (ὁ, ἡ, τό; ὅς, ἥ, ὅ; τις, τίς; ὅδε, οὗτος, ἐκεῖνος)

-personal, reflexive, reciprocal pronouns

-consonant declension (two pages)

-quantifiers: πολύς, μέγας, comparatives in -ων, πᾶς all, εἷς one, οὐδείς no-one, 2, 3, 4.

-λύω 

-εἰμί, εἶμι, φημί, look-alikes οἴομαι, οἶδα, εἶδον

-contract verbs

-aorists: sigmatic, 'pseudo-sigmatic', thematic

-perfect

-mi verbs, present stem forms

-mi verbs, aorist stem forms + ἔγνων  

-ἵστημι overview

*Mayandmight.pdf* gives an overview of uses of subj and optative; plus an overview of conditionals. 

*Squiggles.pdf* gives a first introduction to accentuation (limitation and properispomenon (σωτῆρα) rules only)

*Lion.pdf* is the old 'Adventure with a Lion', with accents added. Not a complete overview of prepositions! This is a version slightly adapted from _Teach Yourself Greek_; here's hoping one page with edits falls under 'fair use'. 
 'U. 12' is an outdated reference to prepositions introduced in unit 12 in the first edition of D.J. Mastronarde, _Introduction to Attic Greek_.
