Mayandmight.pdf gives an overview of uses of subj and optative; plus an overview of conditionals. 

Squiggles.pdf gives a first introduction to accentuation (limitation and properispomenon (σωτῆρα) rules only)

Lion.pdf is the old 'Adventure with a Lion', with accents added. Not a complete overview of prepositions! 

  'U. 12' is an outdated reference to prepositions introduced in unit 12 in the first edition of D.J. Mastronarde, _Introduction to Attic Greek_.
